Week 2!

Week one went off without a hitch.  Got department approval on building the application and connecting it to D2L.  Built the MVC layout and started with the seven-segment model and the basic algorithm that will be used in generating the seven-segment display problem and how to store the binary answer.  

Started on the view using Swing/AWT with a basic simple layout with two buttons one for practice and the other for homework.  Will use this to start generating problems and then build up from there.  

Still need to create the services connecting the model and view segments.
