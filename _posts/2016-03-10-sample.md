I’m currently working on a car maintenance app to track different maintenance events.   It would be customizable so a user would enter the basic information for their vehicle.  Once the basic information is entered the user would be instructed to a screen for what type of maintenance item they are interested in tracking.  

I think the end goal would be for an individual to enter the basic information of their vehicle and then it would pull the manufacturer recommended maintenance so they could track.  

I need to figure out how hard it would be to gather all the manufacturers recommended maintenance to one place.  If the information isn’t readily available in large data sets I would limit pulling recommended data for specific vehicles and slowly open it up to other vehicles and manufacturers.  

Below is just about everything you'll need to style in the theme. Check the source code to see the many embedded elements within paragraphs.

### Items to accomplish:

1. Layout

   2. Background
   3. Icons
2. Navigation
   1. How do i change switchboards
   2. Button controls
3. Customizable inputs

5. Can I calculate maintenance by miles?
   1. Pull miles from iPhone?
   2. User inputed miles?
   3. Calculate current miles against next maintenance
6. Single source of all manufacturer recommended maintenance
   1. Database hosted with a website?
   2. Small data set to start
