Week 3 almost half way done!

Finished the basic layout with the practice side, homework side.  Buttons to submit, reset and a hint button to do something in the future.  I still need to add an intermediate step after the practice button is clicked to have the student choose the number of problems to practice on.

The layout isn't really what I am wanting and may end up starting over with JavaFX.  The more I research it the better it looks to fit my needs.  I have never really been a fan of Net Beans GUI Palette so I have been doing everything by hand.  Creating Frames and Panels and lining up everything has been simple enough but its not the look I am going for.  

I also built out most of the services to help with everything.  I still need the DB service and connections.  I have the basic algorithm to generate the problem, the display and store the answer.  Need to get the users submission and grade it against the problem.
