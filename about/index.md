 As a kid I was always a tinkerer and spent a lot of time in my younger days getting
 yelled at by my parents for taking things apart.  I was a bonafide expert in taking things apart but an amateur at best with putting things back together.  This brought me to my teenage years where I loved to tinker with cars and figure out how they worked.  I wouldn't consider myself an expert in this area but my fianc√© sure does appreciate it.  

 It wasn't until my first deployment with the military that I really did anything with my creative/engineering side of my brain when I took a couple courses through [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread to be able to learn Python, Java and C# for free from a reputable college.  After a couple courses I decided it might be better to actually pursue a degree in Computer Science and enrolled at [Regis University](regis.edu).  

 I am a senior at Regis finishing out my degree in Computer Science.  I currently work full time for a defense contractor doing Program Management and serve in the United States Air Force Reserves as a Maintenance Officer.  

## Skills I am currently crushing:

* Java
* JavaScript
* C++
* SQL
* Swift
* ICEfaces
* Tomcat
* HTML5
* CSS
